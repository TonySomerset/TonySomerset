- 👋 Hi, I’m @TonySomerset a volunteer warden for a butterfly reserve. 
- 👀 Jumped into the deep end to map and capture the data about this reserve so am struggling to use QGIS. ..
- 🌱 Some prior Autocad has helped but am struggling with the user interfaces. 
- 💞️ Powerful tools but ONLY if you know they are there then how you are expected to use them. Complicated large irregular polygon has thrown multiple vertices issues. 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
